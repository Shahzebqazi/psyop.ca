# Psyop - Website

> Note: Fallback branch only — not merging to `main`. This branch must contain only the minimal fallback website. All production front-end code (enhanced UI/components/assets not required for the fallback) should be removed or kept disabled. The canonical production site should not be built from this branch.

A modern, responsive website for the metal band PSYOP, built with Haskell featuring a component-based architecture and tomato red accent styling. **✅ All critical functionality has been restored and the website is now fully operational.**
